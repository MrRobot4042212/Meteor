//! Process-wide Job Object for the metrics sidecars (`PresentMon.exe`,
//! `cputemp.exe`).
//!
//! Both sidecars run **elevated** and hold system resources (an ETW realtime
//! session; a kernel driver). Previously they were tracked by PID and killed
//! with `taskkill /F /PID` on exit — which loses the race against PID reuse
//! (the PID may belong to something else by then) and, worse, does nothing at
//! all if Meteor is killed, crashes, or aborts on panic (`panic = "abort"`),
//! leaving an orphaned elevated process behind.
//!
//! A Job Object with `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` makes the kernel do
//! it: when our last handle to the job goes away — including when the process
//! dies for any reason — every process assigned to it is terminated. The job
//! contains only our own sidecars; a game is never assigned to it.
