//! Backend-independent foreground-window helpers (Windows only).
//!
//! Previously this module also held a GDI layered-window HUD as a fallback backend.
//! That was removed on purpose: a GDI `UpdateLayeredWindow` overlay is never
//! MPO-eligible, so it always drops the game from independent-flip to composed-flip
//! and adds input lag — the exact cost the overlay is meant to avoid. The HUD is now
//! DirectComposition-only (`overlay_dcomp`); if DComp can't init the HUD is disabled
//! rather than falling back to GDI. Only the foreground helpers below survive, used by
//! the facade to gate drawing on the game actually being focused.
