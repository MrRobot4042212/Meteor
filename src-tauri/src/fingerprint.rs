//! Cheap "did the installed-games set change?" probe.
//!
//! A full `get_library` spawns eight scanners, walks three registry hives and
//! (for Xbox) starts a PowerShell process. The frontend ran that every 15
//! minutes regardless of whether anything had changed — usually while the window
//! was hidden in the tray.
//!
//! This computes a fingerprint from the *containers* stores use — library
//! folders, manifest directories, uninstall registry keys — all of which change
//! their last-write time when a game is installed, moved or removed. Comparing
//! it costs a handful of `stat`/`RegQueryInfoKey` calls, so the frontend can
//! skip the expensive scan when the answer is "nothing new".
//!
//! Conservative by construction: anything it cannot read counts as *changed*, so
//! a false "no change" is not possible for a source it can see at all.
