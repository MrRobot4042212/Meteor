/**
 * The library grid.
 *
 * Extracted from `MainApp` and memoized on purpose. The map used to live inline
 * in the page body, which holds ~25 unrelated `useState`s — a toast appearing, a
 * card being dragged, a context menu opening or closing, or a single keystroke in
 * the search box all re-ran it. `GameCard` itself is memoized and every callback
 * below is referentially stable, so no card re-rendered; the cost was the parent
 * rebuilding one React element per game and running a shallow prop comparison for
 * each of them, on every one of those unrelated updates.
 *
 * Keep every prop stable (store actions or `useCallback`) or this goes back to
 * being a plain function call with extra steps.
